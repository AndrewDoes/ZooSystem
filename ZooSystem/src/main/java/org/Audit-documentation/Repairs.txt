1. Large Class (Main.java)
    - Problem : Main program should be separated from it's class
    - Solution: Added app.java to separate the program from main program calling

2. Large Class (App.java)
    - problem : App program handles more than starting the app
    - Solution: Extract class to:
                - AdminManager for handling admin request
                - UserInterfaceHandler for handling UI request
                - VisitorManager for handling visitor request
